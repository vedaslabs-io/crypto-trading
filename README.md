# Thetachain Development ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)

**Thetascreener** is an innovative DeFi platform built on the **Theta blockchain**, an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible network. Our project is designed to enhance the Theta ecosystem by offering real-time decentralized exchange (DEX) data and tools for traders and investors. With the rising demand for decentralized finance solutions, Thetascreener aims to bring transparency, insight, and automation to the Theta blockchain community, empowering users to make informed decisions with ease.

## Overview

Thetascreener's primary function mirrors that of **Dexscreener**, providing users with up-to-date token prices, trading volumes, and market data across DEXs operating on the Theta blockchain. Built on an EVM-based chain, Thetascreener integrates seamlessly with the Theta network, offering a familiar yet advanced toolset for traders.

Beyond basic DEX tracking, Thetascreener goes further by incorporating key DeFi features such as **staking** and **automated trading bots**. Users can not only monitor the market but also take advantage of powerful tools to grow their investments through staking and optimize trading strategies using trading bots.
